# A search app for Spotify
## Made using SvelteKit, Skeleton UI, Tailwind and etc.


## In order to use the app you need to create and put a ".env" in the main directory of the app, and that file's contents need to look like this:
```
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=<YOUR SPOTIFY CLIEND ID>
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=<YOUR SPOTIFY CLIENT SECRET>
```
## You can get the ID and Secret from here - [https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api](Spotify API Docs)
