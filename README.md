# A search app for Spotify
## Made using SvelteKit, Skeleton UI, Tailwind and etc.


## In order to use the app you need to create and put a ".env" in the main directory of the app, and that file's contents need to look like this:
```
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=<YOUR SPOTIFY CLIEND ID>
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=<YOUR SPOTIFY CLIENT SECRET>
```
## You can get the ID and Secret from here - [Spotify API Docs](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api)

### Note:
To run the app (after completing the ".env" step) do ```npm i``` and then ```npm run dev```.
